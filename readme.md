## Description

This is my project folder for the MLVOT assignment. The `output` folder contains the results, and my report is also included in this directory.

## Output/Videos

You will find two videos in the `output` folder:  
- The first video, **`Yolov5l_KelmanFilter_video.mp4`**, is the final video demonstrating the Kalman-Guided IoU Tracking.  
- The second video, **`Yolov5l_Reid_video.mp4`**, showcases the result of applying the ReID filter in addition (this implementation does not work correctly).  

## Code

The code for TP4 has been provided to showcase the work produced. It is located in the `Code/TP4.py` folder. The data has not been provided.
